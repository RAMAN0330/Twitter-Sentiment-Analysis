# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

**OVERVIEW:**

This project aims to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data, specifically from Twitter, to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), involves identifying, extracting, and quantifying sentiment from text data, which helps organizations understand and respond to public sentiment.

**Tasks Implemented:**

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - We begin by delving into the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset to understand its structure, features, and contents.
   - This step involves inspecting the dataset for key attributes such as tweet text, timestamps, user information, and any pre-existing sentiment labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - We preprocess the text data to clean and prepare it for sentiment analysis.
   - This involves several tasks, including:
     - **Text Normalization:** Converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and special characters.
     - **Tokenization:** Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
     - **Noise Removal:** Filtering out stop words and irrelevant information.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Utilizing the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, we analyze the sentiment of each tweet in the dataset.
   - This process involves classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories using various NLP techniques and algorithms provided by NLTK.

4. **Visualization:**
   - We employ popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations.
   - These visualizations illustrate:
     - **Sentiment Trends Over Time:** How sentiment changes over different time periods.
     - **Sentiment Distribution:** The proportion of positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
     - **Sentiment Patterns:** Overall sentiment patterns and their relation to specific topics or brands.
   - By visualizing the data, we aim to provide a clear and comprehensive view of public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands on Twitter.

Through this project, we aim to leverage sentiment analysis to transform raw social media data into actionable insights, aiding organizations in making informed decisions based on public sentiment.

**Libraries and Tools Used:**
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** For sentiment analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For enhancing the visualizations.

**How to Run the Project:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in the repository to perform data exploration, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization.

**Conclusion**:

- This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis and visualization can be applied to social media data to extract meaningful insights about public opinion. By analyzing sentiment trends and patterns, organizations can better understand and respond to the sentiments expressed by their audience on social media platforms.
